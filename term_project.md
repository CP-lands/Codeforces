Personal project: Display 3D shape movement of arbitrary videos. 

In this project, the input is an arbitrary video, the output is a respective video in which it displays 3D shapes of people appeared in the input video. Currently, 
I do this project for fun and somewhat challenge myself. However, I believe that it could be applied in some random field. 

**To do list in the remaining one and half months:**
I will divide the process into 3 stages, each stage may take roundly a half month. 
- Stage 1: Read the input video and explit the video into image frames. Then get the 2D joints of each image frame.
- Stage 2: In each image frame, creating a SMPL 3D shape according to the acquired 2D joints.
- Stage 3: Merging all the SMPL 3D shapes in each image frame to make a video of 3D shapes.
